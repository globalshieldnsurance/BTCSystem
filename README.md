   * Paste the server key to the **API Key** input box below.

     ![](Images/Deployment/configure-notification-hub-gcm.png)

     Click **Save**.

4. Configure **Apple (APNS)**:

   The [iOS simulator does not support push notifications](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/iOS_Simulator_Guide/TestingontheiOSSimulator.html), so for this step, you need a physical iOS device and an [Apple Developer Program membership](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/).

   - [Register an App ID for your app](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingProfiles/MaintainingProfiles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH30-SW991). Create an explicit App ID (not a wildcard App ID) and for Bundle ID, use the exact Bundle ID that is in your iOS project. It is also crucial that you check the Push Notifications option.

   - Next, [configure push notifications](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH26-SW6). You may create either a "Development" or "Distribution" SSL certificate.

   - On your Mac, launch **Keychain Access**. Open **Category** > **My Certificates**. Find the SSL certificate to export (that you downloaded earlier) and disclose its contents. Select only the certificate without selecting the private key, and [export it](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH20122?locale=en_US).

   - Click **Upload Certificate**. Upload the .p12 push certificate file you exported earlier. 

     ![](Images/Deployment/configure-notification-hub-apns.png)

     > **Note**: Make sure to select **Sandbox** if you created a development push certificate for development and testing. 	Otherwise, choose **Production**.

   - Click **Save**.


**Initialize the Storage Account**

1. Get the name and key of the Storage Account.

   ![](Images/Deployment/azure-storage-account.png)
   ​	
   ![Get the name and key of the storage account](Images/Deployment/get-name-and-key-of-the-storage-account.png)

2. Execute the **src/Cloud/InitStorage.ps1** PowerShell script. 

   >**Note:** The PowerShell below will create necessary blob containers and queues.
   > Please Use the *Storage Account Name* and *Storage Account Key* associated with your Storage Account.

   ```PowerShell
   ./InitStorage.ps1 <<Your Storage Account Name>> <<Your Storage Account Key>>
   ```

## Create Customer User Accounts ##

The customer user accounts used to sign into the mobile app are Microsoft Accounts.  Each time you sign into the mobile app, the system checks to see if you have previously signed in with the Microsoft Account and proceeds like this:

- If you **have not** signed in to the mobile app with the Microsoft Account before, the system creates records in the SQL databases associated with the account and uploads the customers sample vehicle images to blob storage.  Then, the mobile app displays the vehicles page in the mobile app.
- If you **have** signed in with the Microsoft Account before, the mobile app loads the vehicles page in the mobile app.

  >**Note:**  The following app setting in the api web app's web.config file controls if data is auto seeded for new users.  If you do not want to auto seed data for new users set this value to false.
  >
  >```xml
  > <add key="AutoSeedUserData" value="true"/>
  >```
  > If you change this app setting vale after you deploy the web api app and you deploy again with the ARM template then you will have to manually change it again.

    ![](Images/Deployment/HockeyApp-Insight.png)

## How To: Install the web application for local execution and debugging ##

1. Use Visual Studio 2015 to open the **src/Cloud/ContosoInsurance-Cloud.sln** Visual Studio Solution file.
2. Right click the **ContosoInsurance.Web** project and select **Set as StartUp Project**.  
3. Press **F5**.
4. Observe the web browser open and load the Contoso Insurance claims search page.

## How To: View the custom events and metrics in Application Insights to monitor and debug the application

The sample logs status information and exceptions to Application Insights for every step in the process.  This starts moment they are received from the mobile app and continues until the very end when a claim is manually approved or rejected by the claims adjuster.

To view the custom events and metrics in Application Insights follow these steps.

1. Open https://portal.azure.com in a web browser and log in.
2. Click the **Application Insights** link in the left menu.
3. Click the **contosoinsurance** Application Insights application that was created when you deployed all the components.
4. Click **Search**.

    ![](Images/Deployment/App-Insights-Search.png)

5. Observe all of the Custom Events.

    ![](Images/Deployment/App-Insights-Search-Results.png)

6. Click a Custom Event in the list to see the metrics logged for the event.

    >**Note:**  You can refer to the Application Insights Logging Matrix in the [Azure Components document](/Azure Components.docx) to see all of the Custom Metrics logged for each Custom Event.  In the example below you can see this custom event was written by the HandleNewClaim Azure Function when it invoked the ClaimAutoApprover Azure Function.

    ![](Images/Deployment/App-Insights-Custom-Event.png)

**Track an individual claim**

Each claim has a CorrelationId associated with it.  You can see this in the screenshot above.  The CorrelationId is used to track the claims from the moment they are received from the mobile app until the end of the process.  You can track the flow of a single claim through the Azure components and the web application by using the CorrelationId.  Here's how to do it:

1. Copy the CorrelationId from a Custom Event.
2. Click **Search**.

        ![](Images/Deployment/App-Insights-Search.png)

3. Paste the CorrelationId into the **Search textbox** and observe all the Custom Events associated with the CorrelationId.

        >**Note:**  This is an excellent way to debug errors in the system and is also especially helpful to determine how long a given step takes to execute.  This sample typically processes claims from the point where they are submitted in the mobile app to the point where they are ready for manual approval in 15 seconds when running the sample on the most basic App Services service level!

        ![](Images/Deployment/App-Insights-Search-Results-CorrelationId.png) 

**Track an individual claim with Application Insights Analytics**

In addition to viewing all the Custom Events associated with a CorrelationId in the Application Insights Search interface, you can use Application Insights Analytics to track an individual claim.

Here is the query to run in Application Insights Analytics to track an individual claim's CorrelationId.

```
customEvents
    | where customDimensions.CorrelationId =~ "<YOUR CORRELATION ID>"
    | project timestamp, customDimensions.LogType, name, customMeasurements, customMeasurements.Host, customDimensions.Description, customDimensions.FunctionName, customDimensions.Status, customDimensions.Version
| order by timestamp asc
```
As you can see below, this claim took 22 seconds to process.

![](Images/Deployment/Application-Insights-Analytics.png)

## How To: Wipe all claims ##

As you use the demo, many claims will accumulate in the databases and in the blob storage container.  To wipe the claims and reset the demo, perform the the following steps:

1. Open the Web App in a web browser and log in.

   ![](Images/Deployment/azure-web-app.png)

## How To: Take an new Picture on the Android simulator ##

If you want to print out the demo images for license plates, insurance cards, and driver's licenses and use the simulator to take a picture of them, here's how to do it.

>**Note:** Here, we use the **5" KitKat(4.4) XXHDPI Phone (Android 4.4 - API19)** simulator to demonstrate these steps.


>**Note:** You must configure your simulator to use a web cam attached to your computer to take a picture.  See these [instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html) to learn how to do this.

1. Open the ContosoInsurance App in the Android simulator.

2. Click the **Camera** button.
